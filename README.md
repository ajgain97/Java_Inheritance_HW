# Program Information
This program consists of three classes, a main class, the GeometricObject class, and a Triangle class.
The Triangle class extends from the GeometricObject class.
The user will be asked to enter the 3 sides and the color of the triangle.
The user will also be asked to enter if the triangle is filled or not by entering a true if it is filled and a false if it not filled
The results will be printed to the screen and to a file called triangleOut.txt
When the program is run again, the new data will be appended to the old data in the file.

# Notes
Added isTriangleValid() method to Triangle class; area would return NaN if triangle was not checked
IOException not needed for Printwriter, only FileNotFoundException
The user input is in the setter methods in the Triangle class
do-while loop added for convenience
Program information is in a method to clean up main method
