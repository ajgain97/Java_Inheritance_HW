## Program Information

This program consists of three classes, a main class, the GeometricObject class, and a Triangle class.

The Triangle class extends from the GeometricObject class.

The user will be asked to enter the 3 sides and the color of the triangle.

The user will also be asked to enter if the triangle is filled or not by entering a true if it is filled and a false if it not filled

The results will be printed to the screen and to a file called triangleOut.txt

When the program is run again, the new data will be appended to the old data in the file.

## Notes

Added isTriangleValid() method to Triangle class; area would return NaN if triangle was not checked

IOException not needed for Printwriter, only FileNotFoundException

The user input is in the setter methods in the Triangle class

do-while loop added for convenience

Program information is in a method to clean up main method
